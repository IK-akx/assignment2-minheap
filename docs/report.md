# MinHeap Algorithm Implementation and Analysis Report
## Iskander Kustayev (SE-2403)
## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive **Min-Heap** data structure in Java as part of Algorithm Design and Analysis coursework. The implementation includes advanced features like performance instrumentation, empirical benchmarking, and optimized merge operations, providing both theoretical understanding and practical performance validation.

## Architecture and Implementation

### Core Data Structure

The MinHeap is implemented as a **binary heap** using an array-based representation with the following key characteristics:

- **Generic Implementation**: Supports any comparable object type via `T extends Comparable<T>`
- **Handle-based Access**: Uses `HeapHandle` objects for external references to heap elements
- **Index Mapping**: Maintains a HashMap for O(1) element lookup during decreaseKey operations
- **Dynamic Resizing**: Automatically expands capacity when needed

### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Key Features |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| `MinHeap` | Core heap implementation | All standard operations + optimized merge |
| `PerformanceTracker` | Metrics collection | Tracks time, comparisons, swaps, memory usage |
| `BenchmarkRunner` | CLI benchmarking | Configurable tests with CSV export |
| `MinHeapBenchmark` | JMH microbenchmarks | Precise performance measurement |

## Operations and Algorithms

### Core Operations Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space | Description |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| **insert()** | O(log n) | O(1) | Adds element and percolates up |
| **extractMin()** | O(log n) | O(1) | Removes root and heapifies down |
| **decreaseKey()** | O(log n) | O(1) | Updates key and restores heap property |
| **peekMin()** | O(1) | O(1) | Returns root without removal |
| **merge()** | O(n + m) | O(n + m) | Optimized linear-time heap combination |

### Algorithmic Optimizations

1. **Optimized Merge Operation**: Instead of naive O(n log n) insertion-based merging, the implementation uses array concatenation followed by linear heap construction.

2. **Efficient Heapify**: The `heapifyDown` method minimizes comparisons by tracking the smallest element during traversal.

3. **Handle System**: Enables efficient decreaseKey operations without searching through the entire heap.

## Performance Instrumentation

### Metrics Collected

The `PerformanceTracker` class captures comprehensive performance data:

- **Time Measurements**: Nanosecond-precision operation timing
- **Operation Counts**: Comparisons, swaps, array accesses
- **Memory Usage**: Before and after memory consumption
- **Allocation Tracking**: Dynamic memory allocation events

### Benchmarking Capabilities

**CLI Benchmark Runner**:
```bash
java -cp target/classes cli.BenchmarkRunner \
  --minSize=100 --maxSize=10000 --step=10 \
  --repeats=3 --output=performance.csv
```

**JMH Microbenchmarks**:
- Warmup iterations: 3
- Measurement iterations: 5
- Fork count: 2
- Time unit: microseconds

## Empirical Analysis

### Performance Characteristics

Based on the collected performance data:

| Operation | Empirical Growth | Theoretical Alignment |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Insert** | Logarithmic | âœ… Confirms O(log n) |
| **ExtractMin** | Logarithmic | âœ… Confirms O(log n) |
| **DecreaseKey** | Logarithmic | âœ… Confirms O(log n) |
| **Merge** | Linear | âœ… Confirms O(n + m) |

### Memory Efficiency

- **Base Storage**: O(n) for heap array and index map
- **Per-operation**: O(1) auxiliary space
- **Dynamic Growth**: Amortized O(1) for resize operations

## ðŸ”§ Build and Execution

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Build and test
mvn clean test

# Run benchmarks
mvn compile
java -cp target/classes cli.BenchmarkRunner

# JMH benchmarking
mvn clean compile dependency:copy-dependencies
java -cp "target/classes;target/dependency/*" cli.BenchmarkRunner
```

### Output Generation

Benchmark results are exported as CSV files with columns:
- Input size (n)
- Operation type
- Execution time (nanoseconds)
- Operation counts (comparisons, swaps, etc.)
- Memory usage metrics

## Theoretical vs Empirical Alignment

### Confirmed Complexities

The empirical data strongly supports the theoretical complexity analysis:

1. **Logarithmic Operations**: insert, extractMin, decreaseKey all show characteristic logarithmic growth patterns when plotted against input size.

2. **Linear Merge**: The optimized merge operation demonstrates linear scaling, significantly outperforming naive O(n log n) approaches.

3. **Constant Factors**: The actual performance constants align with expectations for array-based heap implementations.

### Validation Methodology

- **Multiple Runs**: Repeated measurements to account for JVM variability
- **Various Sizes**: Testing across different input scales (100 to 10,000 elements)
- **Statistical Analysis**: Average performance across multiple iterations

## Potential Enhancements

### Immediate Improvements

1. **CSV Appending Mode**: Modify PerformanceTracker to append to existing files rather than overwriting
2. **Memory Optimization**: Consider alternative data structures for the index map to reduce memory overhead
3. **Benchmark Isolation**: Improve benchmark purity by reducing setup overhead in measurements

### Advanced Features

1. **Concurrent Operations**: Thread-safe implementation for multi-threaded environments
2. **Bulk Operations**: Optimized batch insertion and extraction methods
3. **Custom Comparators**: Support for different ordering semantics beyond natural ordering
4. **Visualization Tools**: Integration with graphing libraries for automatic chart generation

## Key Insights
